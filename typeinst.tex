\section{Introduction}


- work aims to summarize recent development and good approaches in music recommendation (state of art)

\section{State-of-the-art}
In 2020 Melchiorre, Zangerle \textit{et al.} proposed their work were they analyzed the personality bias of common algorithms in the area of music recommendation.
They stated that other work already proved that there is for example a bias on item or user level in multimedia recommendations. 
Addtionally there exists work proving a correlation between music preferences and personality traits.\\
For their experiment they created a novel dataset combining user's personality traits and music consumption.
To gather this data they used Twitter microblog posts with certain hashtags as well as the music metadata dataset MusicBrainz. 
Using the \textit{IBM Personality Insight API} the authors were able to integrate the user's personality traits according to the \textit{OCEAN} model of psychology.
The authors compared \textit{Recall@K} and \textit{NDCG@K} (normalized discounted cummulative gain), with K being the length of the recommendation list, of three popular music recommenders namely \textit{SLIM}, \textit{EASE} and \textit{Mult-VAE}.
They were able to prove that low scores on personality traits such as \textit{openness}, \textit{extraversion} and \textit{conscientiousness} lead to higher performance
while low scores for \textit{neuroticism} and \textit{agreeableness} lead to low performance according to the chosen metrics. 
Finally they stated some limitations of their work as well as planned extensions. \cite{melchiorre2020personality}\\
\\
% TODO 
\textit{CAME}, content and context-aware music embedding for recommendation, is a novel approach proposed by Wang, Zhang \textit{et al.}.
They stated that traditional methods often have limitations due to missing additional information aspects. 
Therefore they aim to comnbine content and contextual information for better music recommendations. 
This is achieved by using a heterogeneous information network in combination with deep learning.
\cite{wang2020came}
\\
\\
In their work Niyazov, Mikhailova \textit{et al.} proposed a novel approach for content-based music recommendation. 
They want to recommend suitable music to users based on the acoustic similarity of songs.
This means that they use the acoustig signal of a song transformed into a suitable representation. 
To find the best approach they performed two seperate experiments and afterwards compared the quantitative results.\\
The first experiment is based on acoustic feature analysis. 
They extract acoustic features from songs, transform them into a vector representation and use 10 Nearest Neighbors with Euclidean distance 
to get the 10 best recommendations per song. \\
The second experiment is using artificial neural networks. 
The networks are trained using spectogram representations of the acoustic signals.
Using the model a vector representation for each song is predicted. 
Similar to the first approach using 10-NN the best 10 recommendations per song are gathered. \\
Both approaches got compared with random recommendations using precision, recall, F1-score and a version of the F1-score with a threshold of 0.4.
This means that all recommendations below this value are considered as irrelevant. The value was introduced by the authors based on their evaluation.\\
Comparing the quantitative measurements the authors were able to conclude that both approaches outperformed the random recommendation
whit the second approach using Neural Networks achieving the best results. \\
Addtionally the authors invesitaged genre-specific clustering via visualizing vector spaces on a plane. 
Due to genre-specific clustering being closely related to the acoustic sound of songs this again highlighted their findings that approaches 
using ANN achieve better results. \cite{niyazov2021content}


La Gatta, Moscato \textit{et al.} proposed a novel approach for music recommendation using hypergraph embedding.
They split their work into three main parts.
First they invesitaged how to model and store the relevant data in a hypergraph-based structure.
Afterwards they focussed on generating hypergraph embeddings from their dataset.
The third part of their work was the actual recommendation task where they used graph-based machine learning to 
generate the top-k track recommendations for each user. \\
One core challenge of their work was the modelling of scenarios such as a song being part of an album, users listening to songs, et cetera.
This was done using a hypergraph-based structure which has vertices and edges but also metadata information.\\
For evaluation La Gatta, Moscato \textit{et al.} compared their novel approach with other state-of-the-art music recommenders such as \textit{CAME} \cite{wang2020came}.
They were able to surpass them at some quality metrics. \cite{la2022music}

\section{Critical discussion and evaluation}
% TODO

- personality trait -> nur twitter data considered -> gilt wsl net fia ganze population
- incomplete data (net zu allem access)
- eher wie user sein wollen (was sie posten) als was sie wirklöich anhean -> kann also von user verfälscht sein 

- some papers (e.g. niyazov) nur quantitative evaluation und eher poor results 
- only public dataset not perfect passend 
- nehmen nur bruchtteil vom dataset und assumen dass genug is = net getestet und geproved 


- zusammenfassedn hat jeder approach irgendwo seine limitation 
- sei es auf zu kleienn daten mengen getestet oder andererseits wieder nicht schnell / zuverlkässig genug 
- große dienste wie spotify  = highly compoetitive

%\subsection{Figures}

%For \LaTeX\ users, we recommend using the \emph{graphics} or \emph{graphicx}
%package and the \verb+\includegraphics+ command.

%Please check that the lines in line drawings are not
%interrupted and are of a constant width. Grids and details within the
%figures must be clearly legible and may not be written one on top of
%the other. Line drawings should have a resolution of at least 800 dpi
%(preferably 1200 dpi). The lettering in figures should have a height of
%2~mm (10-point type). Figures should be numbered and should have a
%caption which should always be positioned \emph{under} the figures, in
%contrast to the caption belonging to a table, which should always appear
%\emph{above} the table; this is simply achieved as matter of sequence in
%your source.

%Please center the figures or your tabular material by using the \verb+\centering+
%declaration. Short captions are centered by default between the margins
%and typeset in 9-point type (Fig.~\ref{fig:example} shows an example).
%The distance between text and figure is preset to be about 8~mm, the
%distance between figure and caption about 6~mm.

%If screenshots are necessary, please make sure that you are happy with
%the print quality before you send the files.
%\begin{figure}
%\centering
%\includegraphics[height=6.2cm]{eijkel2}
%\caption{One kernel at $x_s$ (\emph{dotted kernel}) or two kernels at
%$x_i$ and $x_j$ (\textit{left and right}) lead to the same summed estimate
%at $x_s$. This shows a figure consisting of different types of
%lines. Elements of the figure described in the caption should be set in
%italics, in parentheses, as shown in this sample caption.}
%\label{fig:example}
%\end{figure}

%Please define figures (and tables) as floating objects. Please avoid
%using optional location parameters like ``\verb+[h]+" for ``here".

%\paragraph{Remark 1.}

%In the printed volumes, illustrations are generally black and white
%(halftones), and only in exceptional cases, and if the author is
%prepared to cover the extra cost for color reproduction, are colored
%pictures accepted. Colored pictures are welcome in the electronic
%version free of charge. If you send colored figures that are to be
%printed in black and white, please make sure that they really are
%legible in black and white. Some colors as well as the contrast of
%converted colors show up very poorly when printed in black and white.

%\subsection{Formulas}

%Displayed equations or formulas are centered and set on a separate
%line (with an extra line or halfline space above and below). Displayed
%expressions should be numbered for reference. The numbers should be
%consecutive within each section or within the contribution,
%with numbers enclosed in parentheses and set on the right margin --
%which is the default if you use the \emph{equation} environment, e.g.,
%\begin{equation}
%  \psi (u) = \int_{o}^{T} \left[\frac{1}{2}
%  \left(\Lambda_{o}^{-1} u,u\right) + N^{\ast} (-u)\right] dt \;  .
%\end{equation}

%Equations should be punctuated in the same way as ordinary
%text but with a small space before the end punctuation mark.

%\subsection{Footnotes}

%The superscript numeral used to refer to a footnote appears in the text
%either directly after the word to be discussed or -- in relation to a
%phrase or a sentence -- following the punctuation sign (comma,
%semicolon, or period). Footnotes should appear at the bottom of
%the
%normal text area, with a line of about 2~cm set
%immediately above them.\footnote{The footnote numeral is set flush left
%and the text follows with the usual word spacing.}

%\subsection{Program Code}

%Program listings or program commands in the text are normally set in
%typewriter font, e.g., CMTT10 or Courier.
